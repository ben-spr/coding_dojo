I am a Software Engineer and want to practice working with regular expressions using the re module in Python.
Please create a practice tasks for me to do that. The goal of all tasks should be to define a regular expression that captures a specific pattern.
For all tasks, please provide a task description including an example of the pattern.
Separately, not as part of the task description, for each task provide:
- a function to generate dummy data to test the solution, containing both matches and invalid entries. The data should be written to a .txt file.
- the regex that solves the task


Task 1:
The pattern should be license plates for cars from Hannover, Germany.
A Hannover license plate consists of 3 groups:
1. 'H'
2. two random uppercase letters
3. 3 to 4 numbers.
The dummy data should be a randomly sorted list with 200 entries. 
The dummy data should not all match the expression and should contain vehicles that start with 'BS' or 'WOB' as group 1 instead of 'H' as well.
The task is to find all vehicles from Hannover and separate them into city (3 numbers) and region (4 numbers).

Task 2:
The pattern should be valid phone numbers.



And separately, not as part of the task:
- a function to generate dummy data to test the solution
- the regex that solves the task

The dummy data should be a randomly sorted list with 200 entries. 
The dummy data should not all match the expression and should contain vehicles that start with 'BS' or 'WOB' instead of 'H' as well.
The task is to find all vehicles from Hannover and separate them into city (3 numbers) and region (4 numbers).


Please provide the entries that should be matched in a second list as well.
